		<div>Every definition is a theory about the world, albeit in most cases a simple one.<br>
<br>
By that I mean that when we define something, we're creating a framework for making predictions about the world around us.  Consider two words:<br>
<br>
<b>Table</b>:  A piece of furniture with four legs and a flat top.<br>
<br>
<b>Antique</b>:  A piece of furniture of unusually great age.<br>
<br>
If you ask me "What's in the dining room?" I could answer "a table" or "an antique".  Because these words exist, I can use them to make a claim about the properties of the dining room, a falsifiable prediction.<br>
<br>
But note that a word, like any theory, doesn't capture the totality of reality.  It encompasses particular features and ignores others.  We don't have a word for "a piece of furniture colored purple with brass nails", for example.   This constrains the sorts of ways that I can answer your question about the nature of the dining room.<br>
<br>
And, in fact, there might be potential categories of knowledge that I don't even realize that I lack words to express.  For example, the object in the dining room might be radioactive.  Not only do we not have a word for "a piece of furniture that is radioactive", two hundred years ago we wouldn't even have known that "being radioactive" was a property for an object to have.  Whether the antique table is radioactive or not is not dependent upon language.  But our capacity to KNOW that the table is a table, and is an antique, and is radioactive, is.</div>

</div>I forgot which philosopher said it but I paraphrase it as, "<i>you can't disentangle words from knowledge.</i>"  Apparently, some philosophers have tried to create an ultra-precise non-ambiguous meta-terminology to describe both knowledge and the words associated to that knowledge but Ludwig Wittgenstein showed that this was impossible to do.<br>
<br>
In many ways, this self-referencing limitation is similar to Godel's Incompleteness Theorem for formalizing mathematics.<br>

</div>Thank you for the compelling article. It brings up a lot of interesting points regarding how certain languages somehow oblige us to focus on certain details of ourselves, our actions, and the objects around us. This could practically affect our habits and tastes. But perhaps it could also affect how information is processed and communicated. <br>
<br>
Dr. Love, could you elaborate about finding a language to describe mathematical phenomenon. I don't quite understand your distinction between symbolic language and other kinds.</div>

</div>But that doesn't have anything to do with the <i>words</i>. The word is a signifier. it does not, and cannot, reveal anything about the signified. You have to learn that for yourself. What language does do is provide a guide for learning things. if a word exists, then the concept does as well. But people add concepts, and words, all the time - as they are needed for expression.<br>
<br>
I have a huge problem with the Sapir-Worf hypthesis. Specifically, it's incredibly stupid, excect in the weakest form. It's patently obvious that language is an aspect of culture. Language does not define our thinking, it is learned <i>alongside</i> thinking: it does get trasmitted along with cultural notions of value. People do not simply make language randomly in as much as we can tell: they create words deliberately drawing upon cultural knowledge, and imbue them with the meaning they choose.</div>

		<div>Answer: Not much.  We are so used to our own language, we fail to notice that many basic words in it are (or were) really "work-arounds", or semantic extensions or contractions from previous meanings, etc, etc.  Take an English word as basic as "understand".  What are you standing under?  There's an answer (sort of), but it's shrouded in the mists of time, and you don't need to think about this when you hear the word "understand".<br>
<br>
Individual words take up semantic space, as needed, in any language.  It's sort of analogous to "crown shyness" -- how taller trees in many types of forest will spread their canopy so that its edges touch the next tree's canopy just enough to give more or less complete coverage to the canopy as a whole.<br>
<br>
That said, it is true (as a previous poster mentioned) that each language also has its own "encrustations" (as John McWhorter likes to put it), its extra "bells and whistles", including obligatory-in-that-language but fundamentally unnecessary things like, say, noun gender in one language, or definite/indefinite articles in another.  But this is not what this thread is about.</div>

</div>Sigh. What kind of vocabulary? There was an argument made in the 60s that Black children couldn't think logically or form complete thoughts. Why? It was because of how they spoke.But there's nothing wrong with black (AAVE, if you would, but I find that so...odd) English. It's a dialect. Another way of using words to express a meaning.<br>
<br>
However, this isn't to say that the way in which we<b> frame </b>things has no bearing on our thought process. I would also argue that lack of vocabulary in some things prohibits the understanding of others. If you have no vocabulary for the term 'gravity',  you can't possibly understand planetary science - even the basic kindergarten parts. If you acquire a word for the term, then sure. Learn away.<br>
<br>
But i reject the idea that Chinese kids are better at math than Americans because of their inherent genetic brain smarts. I vote that language (and as a result of language, that culture) has something to do with it. <br>
<br>
Not all languages affect brain development the same. A child using a sign language is going to activate much of the same region that Chinese children do when reading characters. This is not the same for oral English-speaking children.<br>
<br>
Like I said, a very modified S-W hypothesis is what I believe in. Basically, relative linguistics.</div>

		<div>I don't know the answer, but let me respond anyway.  :D<br>
<br>
For me, the interesting question is not about relatively complicated vocabulary, but about more basic grammatical forms.  Do languages lacking in tense or number inhibit certain types of cognition?<br>
<br>
I think it is difficult to answer even such a simple-seeming question.  Linguists' own bias may give them a false sense of a language.  For example, Daniel Everett was a key researcher of the Pirahã language mentioned above, and presented a phrase "two big red barrels" as an example in his early paper, but <a href="http://llc.illinoisstate.edu/dlevere/docs/Reply%20in%20Language%202009.pdf" target="_blank">later recanted</a>:<br>

				During the years, however, I noticed that nouns followed or preceded by multiple modifiers are not found in natural conversations or texts. When I asked someone years later why they didn’t utter sequences like ["two big red barrels"], they said<br>
‘Pirahãs do not say that’.<br>
I replied ‘You said I could say that’.<br>
I was answered: ‘You can say that. You are not Pirahã.’

		<div>I'd say that it's definitely, mostly, the opposite way round. What we know shapes our vocabulary. If we discover a new thing, we give it a name, we utilise language to suit our knowledge. But it's a process that moves back and forth. The word 'radioactive' does not convey any inherent meaning. Even if you understand the morphology, radio + active can mean any number of things. So you need to understand the definition before you can use the word effectively. However, the definition is based upon a number of other words + concepts, so yes having a suitable vocabulary is necessary, and does temporarily shape what you know. But it always come back to knowledge first (you need to understand the definitions of the constituent parts of the definition of 'radioactive' to understand the hypernym), it rarely starts with words. Look at how children learn what animals are. Very often they'll begin by identifying with the sounds they make. 'Moo' signifies cow, and this is very often figured out unprompted (the word has inherent properties that connote cow - because the animal itself makes the sound. 'Cow' does not). I have a nephew who, after seeing Lion's roar on television, now always refers to them in picture books as making that sound. The word 'lion' came later. So, it's clear to me that we understand what things are, before we have the words that refer to them. <br>
<br>
We change language and expand upon it to suit our needs, language change rarely (I can't think of any examples, but I'm sure there must be) precedes new understanding.</div>

<br>
Vocabulary is not necessarily most important for verbal communication, but also for construction of thoughts. There must be some connection between the vocabulary one has access to, and the complexity of thoughts that one is  more likely to develop. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, languages change based on the vocabulary that the speaking population requires. Could it be just a reflection of the already-present practical necessities of the population? Again the issue of vocabulary for verbal communication vs. thinking must be considered, because these 2 demands are very different....</div>

</div>There's two things that vocabulary tell me about a person:<br>
<br>
1) If you use various words correctly, you have a wide knowledge of definition, and most likely are a well read person.<br>
<br>
2) If you use slang correctly, you're aware of your current, hip surroundings.<br>
<br>
Learning new words by their REAL and SLANG definitions and using them tells me you're knowledgable in many ways. Especially if you can create some good puns on the spot. :D<br>
<br>
Example: When the whole "actually" thing was going around recently, like, "Actually, I actually, don't really know how to actually get there..." tells me you don't know what actually means. I'd have more respect if you said something like, "Frankly, I don't know the best route without a map or a GPS."</div>

</div>We're talking about several different things here.  The "bells and whistles" do not do much to how a person thinks; a Spanish speaker doesn't care that a bridge is "masculine".  Some grammatical obligatory features more fundamentally require the speaker to develop a certain kind of specialized awareness, such as the absolute-direction languages.  <br>
<br>
But you seem more interested in "vocabulary" -- and "access" to that differs as much from speaker to speaker of the same language as it does from one language to the next.  Sure, there are ideas which one language has a word for and another doesn't -- "wabi sabi" in Japanese, etc., etc. -- and these do usually reflect the importance some idea has for one culture.  But the vocabulary doesn't shape the mind, except at the margins.<br>
<br>
Certainly, "complexity" has little to do with any of this.  It is difficult to measure "complexity", and one language is usually complex in some ways and not others, while the next language is complex, too, but in different ways.<br>
<br>
There are sometimes (debatably) a few ways that complexity can be measured overall, and "creolization" (to put it in an oversimplified way, parents having to use a second language to speak to each other, and their children speaking the result as a first language) will simplify a lot of things pretty consistently (English is more creolized than other Germanic languages except for Afrikaans, e.g.).  "Indigenous" languages, spoke by relatively few people, will thus tend to retain the most "complexity", in many ways.  But I doubt you would contend that German speakers have more access to complex thought than English speakers, and Navajo speakers more than Germans.<br>
<br>
What do you mean by the "vocabulary" of a language?  The sum total -- lexicon -- of all words used by all its speakers?  Spoken, or written?  Which dialects do you include?  How much technical vocabulary do you include?  How do you define any one person's "access" to some defined portion of the total potential lexicon?  This may be a useful exercise for some reason or another, but not, I'm almost sure, for better predicting how a person's mind works, or what they are capable of thinking, or even what they are likely to think (except to the trivially obvious extent that a language's culture and geographic setting, and the things it has words for, will show much correlation for certain kinds of words.)</div>

		<div>Or, to put it more succinctly, the OP commits a fallacy of the excluded middle.  The thought-ways available to anyone are largely channelled (though not strictly limited) by their "culture"; and, portions of any language's lexicon (roughly, "vocabulary") will reflect things particular to one or more of the "cultures" with speakers of that language; but the lexicon does not have much to do with channelling the thought-ways.<br>
<br>
One (of many) reasons why not:  Languages evolve through time, and there is no way to define precisely the moment when a language becomes a different one.  The English lexicon, for maybe 96% of any speaker's utterances, is an Anglo-Saxon base with a Norman French grafting, plus some learnéd Latin filligree.  Are English speakers, then, restricted to the mindsets of 8th-century Saxons, or 12th-century Normans, or 3rd-century Romans?  Of course not.</div>

</div>Vocabulary is a result, not a cause.<br>
<br>
The conditions that produce a specific vocabulary in large societies differ from one to another, so we can end up with a horrid meaningless mash of haphazard words as in English, compared to very sophisticated word structure (not grammar or syntax) like in German, Russian or Greek, but even then, vocabulary is a result, not a cause.<br>
<br>
On an individual level, which I think where your question is aimed at, the more educated a person is the more that person "knows", whatever that means, so in that case then vocabulary can shape that a person can know because it gives a way to formulate abstract ideas in a more concrete way that can be later examined and analyzed.</div>
